# seed.yml - Configuration for Gorchata seed data imports
# This file controls how seed CSV files are loaded into the database

version: 1

# Naming configuration - controls how table names are resolved from seed files
naming:
  # Strategy determines how to resolve the table name:
  #   - filename: use the CSV filename (without extension) as table name
  #   - folder: use the parent folder name as table name
  #   - static: use a fixed table name from static_name below
  strategy: filename  # Options: filename, folder, static
  
  # Static table name (only used when strategy is "static")
  static_name: ""
  
  # Optional prefix to prepend to resolved table names
  # Example: prefix "seed_" with filename strategy on "customers.csv" → "seed_customers"
  prefix: ""

# Import configuration - controls how data is inserted
import:
  # Number of rows to insert in each batch
  # Larger batch sizes are faster but use more memory
  batch_size: 1000
  
  # Scope determines which seed files are processed:
  #   - file: only the specific seed file
  #   - folder: all seed files in the same folder
  #   - tree: all seed files in the folder and subfolders (recursive)
  scope: tree  # Options: file, folder, tree

# Column type overrides - specify SQLite types for specific columns
# If not specified, types are inferred from the CSV data
column_types:
  # Example overrides:
  # customer_id: INTEGER
  # name: TEXT
  # email: TEXT
  # created_at: TEXT
  # balance: REAL
  # is_active: INTEGER

# Additional configuration options (for future use)
config:
  # Example options:
  # quote_columns: true
  # delimiter: ","
  # encoding: "utf-8"
